# ExaModelsPower.jl Test Data
The test cases represented here are original or modified forms of test cases represented
in power-grid-lib

The modified cases have had storage devices added to certain bus(es) in the original 
pglib test case. No other modifications were made. The location of the storage 
devices was chosen arbitrarily. 

The casex_5split.Pd and .Qd files contain temporally varying active and reactive 
power curves, with the baseline set at the demands presented in the static cases,
and arbitrarily altered over 5 different time periods. These cases are meant only
as tests, and their curve profile does not intend to represent any specific 
real-world scenario.
